The ADA defines abnormalities in albumin
excretion as follows:

Albuminuria Category Result (mg/g creatinine)

Normal to Mildly increased <30
Moderately increased 30-299
Severely increased > OR = 300

The ADA recommends that at least two of three
specimens collected within a 3-6 month period be
abnormal before considering a patient to be
within a diagnostic category.

LDL-C is now calculated using the Martin-Hopkins
calculation, which is a validated novel method providing
better accuracy than the Friedewald equation in the
estimation of LDL-C.

HEMOGLOBIN Alc WITH eAG AT HEMOGLOBIN Alc 5.9 H <5.7 % of total Hgb For someone without known
diabetes, a hemoglobin

Alc value between 5.7% and 6.4% is consistent with

prediabetes and should be confirmed with a

follow-up test.

For someone with known diabetes, a value <7%
indicates that their diabetes is well controlled. Alc
targets should be individualized based on duration of
diabetes, age, comorbid conditions, and other
considerations.

This assay result is consistent with an increased risk
of diabetes.

Currently, no consensus exists regarding use of
hemoglobin Alc for diagnosis of diabetes for children.
